Pinboard-Simple-Child
=====================

This is a child theme of Pinboard, it was quickly developed for freshkandb on this ticket:

https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-display-tagline-only-in-header

It's simple, if a header image exists it will not use the site title too. If it doesn't exist, the site title remains. Simples. :)

Original theme:
